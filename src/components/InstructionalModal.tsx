  <p>
      In Olympic diving, each dive is a combination of grace, precision, and a splash of flair! Judges score dives based on two main criteria:
    </p>
    <h3>1. Difficulty (Degree of Difficulty - DD)</h3>
    <p>
      The difficulty of a dive is determined by its complexity. This includes the number and type of twists and somersaults, the position of the diver (tuck, pike, or straight), and the height from which they dive.
    </p>
    <p> The scale goes from <strong> 1.2 to 4.8 </strong> and increments by <strong> 0.1 </strong> </p>
    <h3>2. Execution</h3>
    <p>
      This is where the artistry comes in! Judges rate the execution of the dive on a scale of 0 to 10, considering:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Takeoff:</strong> Was the takeoff smooth and powerful?</li>
        <li><strong>Flight:</strong> How well did the diver perform the maneuvers? Were they controlled and precise?</li>
        <li><strong>Entry:</strong> The goal is to enter the water with minimal splash, creating what's known as a "rip entry."</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your answers will be compared to the actual difficulty score of the dive and the median of the judge's execution score ‚Äîhappy scoring! üåäüèÖ
